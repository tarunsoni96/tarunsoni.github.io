I got my first computer when i was 6, it was pentium 4 with 256MB RAM, My parents bought it for me for my strong liking of video games at that time (Which still is, but not to that extent).

Slowly over time playing games on it, I thought why couldn't i just build my own games and design everthing as i want in a game.

Since then i started with Unity3D game engine it was a big hype back then & started following youtube videos on game tutorials. I designed my first FPS game in javascript, it was pretty basic just movement and gun firing to some objects.

Did game development hobby for a year and shifted to web technologies for websites using latest technologies of that time :

Bootstrap,
Angular,
CodeIgniter,

I designed full stack websites working 12 hrs a day, which really gave me insights on how things actally work in computers and networks.

Stuck with that for 2 years, Shifted to Android which was again a hype for that time.

I still remember i was in my hometown, laptop's battery was on 9% and i compiled my first Untitled project in android studio, and it felt Great! compiling first android project successfully.

And it was at that time i fell in love with Frontend development.

I kept on experimenting with android, rooting phones and unlocking it's abilities which android keeps it locked by blocking root access to OS.

I started developing my personal idea's to apps. And launched some of it. Like OLX i had that idea but not enough money at that time to actually run ad campaigns for it to become successfull, It was a native app in android, i wrote it's backend in PHP, Codeigniter & Mysql.

And from there i kept on going with latest technologies, expermenting new languages and exploring new coding techniques, Currently my favorites Framework in Frontend - React Native (Cross platform Apps in Javascript, What else one need!)

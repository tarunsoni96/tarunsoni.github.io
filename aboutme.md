This is my personal space where I showcase my self-developed projects and blog about my private coding adventures.

I code and code all day long, practice algorithms & different data structures in C++ to plain old Javascript, I like to experiment with different kinds of coding practices (Functional, OOPS) to name few, I always focus on improvising my algorithm implementation skills and it's speed, optimizations & reliability.



<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->

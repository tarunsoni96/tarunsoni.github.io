This is my personal space where I showcase my self-developed projects and blog about my private coding adventures.

It’s updated when I feel like posting bigger news to the world, for more frequent and smaller updates

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I got my first computer when i was 6, it was pentium 4 with 256MB of RAM, It was pretty high end for that time, My parents bought it for my strong liking of video games at that time (Which still is, but not to that extent).

Slowly over time playing games on it, I thought why couldn't i just build my own games and design everthing as i want in a game.

Since then i started with Unity3D game engine it was a big hype back then & started following youtube videos on game tutorials. I designed my first FPS game in javascript, it was pretty basic just movement and gun firing to some objects.

Did game development hobby for a year and shifted to web technologies for websites using latest technologies of that time :

Bootstrap,
Angular,
CodeIgniter,

I designed full stack website working 12 hrs a day, that really gave me insights on how things actally work in computers and online networks.

Stuck with that for 2 years, Shifted to Android which was again a hype for that time.

I still remember i was in my hometown, laptop's battery was on 9% and i compiled my first Untitled project in android studio, and it felt Great! compiling my first android project successfully.

And it was at that time i fell in love with Frontend development.

I kept on experimenting with android, rooting phones and unlocking it's abilities which android keeps it locked by blocking root access to OS.

I started developing my personal idea's to apps. And launched some of it. Like OLX i had that idea but not enough money at that time to actually run ad campaigns for it to become successfull, I wrote it's backend in PHP, Codeigniter & Mysql.

And from there i kept on going with latest technologies, expermenting new languages and exploring new coding techniques, Currently my favorites Framework in Frontend - React Native (Cross platform Apps in Javascript, What else one need!)

______________________________

And NOW 

I'm doing a full time job in Frontend Cross platform development in React Native

I code and code all day long, practice algorithms & different data structures from C++ to plain old Javascript, I like to experiment with different kinds of coding practices (Functional, OOPS) to name few, I always focus on improvising my algorithm implementation skills and it's speed, optimizations & reliability.


Programming languages I use :

JavaScript / TypeScript
C++
PHP

Frameworks I use :

React Native
Laravel
Angular

Platforms I develop for :

Android
iOS
Web

Some of the IDEs I use regularly :

Visual Studio (Code)
Android Developer Studio (IntelliJ)
XCode
Eclipse

List of some of the web frameworks I’ve used :

React
Twitter Bootstrap
jQuery and jQuery UI

Some developer related things I often use:

Source control tools (git, SVN)
Docker

Thank you making it so far! :)
